# R2U2 Front End Selection

R2U2 supports the general-purpose Booleanizer for reasoning about non-Boolean data.

If your specification only has inputs of type `bool`, then the Booleanizer engine is not necessary.

## Booleanizer

The Booleanizer is a general purpose engine that can perform arithmetic, bitwise operations, parameterized set aggregation (`foratleast`, etc.), and other such capabilities.
