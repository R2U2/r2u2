R2\+U2 matlab/octave standalone\+:

\item install tools\+: cd tools/\+L\+T\+L$\ast$/src make make install
\item compile/run formula cd src/\+M\+A\+T\+L\+AB $<$$<$ formula in t1.\+txt $>$$>$

octave

in octave\+: $>$$>$ more off

\% compiles formula and builds R2\+U2 $>$$>$ make\+\_\+r2u2\+\_\+octave(\textquotesingle{}t1\textquotesingle{});

\% run r2u2 on some small data and plot $>$$>$ run\+\_\+t1
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

2A. for matlab\+: similar wrapper


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item N\+O\+T\+ES\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The octave/matlab R2\+U2 only accepts {\itshape binary} input values (width=128)
\item NO signal preprocessing here
\item make\+\_\+r2u2\+\_\+octave\+: errors during compilation of formulas are shown, but the build-\/process continues (must be fixed)
\item there are several run$\ast$.m scripts, which plot results. Some of them are also suitable for future time (sync observers). Only output signals are plotted if they are labeled in the input specification.
\item FT\+: some future time temporal operators are not implemented in this version (sync). Async observers haven\textquotesingle{}t been implemented at all.
