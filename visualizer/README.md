# How to Run Mous3

## 1. Build r2u2 (as of 12/14/2024)
Run the makefile in the monitors directory in the r2u2 directory
```
cd monitors/c

make
```
You should now see a build file in the monitors/c folder

to check that r2u2 exists
```
cd build

ls
```
You should see 
```
libr2u2.a r2u2 release
```

## 2. Go to the mous3 directory
assuming you are in the r2u2 root directory
```
cd visualizer/mous3

```
