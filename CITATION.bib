abstract="R2U2 is a modular runtime verification framework capable of monitoring sets of specifications in real time and in resource-constrained environments. Such environments demand that a runtime monitor be fast, easily integratable, accessible to domain experts, and have predictable resource requirements. Version 3.0 adds new features to R2U2 and its associated suite of tools that meet these needs including a new front-end compiler that accepts a custom specification language, a GUI for resource estimation, and improvements to R2U2's internal architecture.",
